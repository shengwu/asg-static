        <p>
        In general, there are two different avenues under which a student or student group can be prosecuted for underage drinking: through the University and by the City of Evanston.
        </p>
        <p>

          <li>
          Other violations of the University&rsquo;s alcohol policies or state and local laws pertaining to alcoholic beverages, including those governing the transportation, possession, and consumption of alcohol
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        According to the <a href="http://www.northwestern.edu/student-conduct/conduct/code/sanctions/index.html">Code of Conduct</a>, there are a variety of factors involved in determining the severity and number of sanctions one might face, which include nature and severity of the incident, disciplinary history of the student, level of cooperation, accountability and responsibility taken by the student.
        </p>
        <p>
        Disciplinary action from the University following the incident is typically handled by the <a href="http://www.northwestern.edu/student-conduct/">Office of Conduct and Conflict Resolution</a>. Possible sanctions include exclusion from Northwestern University, immediate or deferred suspension, disciplinary and social probation, formal warning, and monetary fine. In case of documentation of on-campus residents, potential outcomes include removal from University housing, housing relocation, and housing probation. Students may also be required to complete an educational program or community service based on the nature of the incident. Severity of sanctions are based on the factors listed previously. More details on these sanctions can be found in the <a href="http://www.northwestern.edu/student-conduct/conduct/code/sanctions/index.html">Code of Conduct</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>For more information about NU&rsquo;s policies regarding alcohol and drugs visit <a href="http://www.northwestern.edu/alcohol-resources/">Alcohol &amp; Other Drug Resources</a>. This website is a hub of information for&nbsp;students about NU policies, programs and services concerning alcohol and other drugs. To examine use and avoid dangerous situations, Health Promotion &amp; Wellness offers a confidential and judgment-free service called <a href="http://www.nuhs.northwestern.edu/evanston/ed/aod.aspx">BASICS</a>.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        The city of Evanston can also be involved in the disciplinary process, especially if the incident takes place off-campus (in an off-campus residence, liquor store, restaurant, etc.). &nbsp;Under the <a href="http://library.municode.com/showDocumentFrame.aspx?clientID=14913&amp;docID=0">Evanston Code of Ordinances</a> it is unlawful for any person under the age of 21 to misrepresent his or her age to obtain alcohol anywhere in the city where alcohol is sold. &nbsp;This is punishable by a fine of $500 to $1000.
        </p>
        <p>
        A person found in violation of these ordinances may also be required to attend an administrative hearing at City Hall in front of a judge. Citation for underage drinking is also punishable by a fine of $500 to $1000. &nbsp;In case of an off-campus incident, the police also notify the University Office of Conduct and Conflict Resolution for further disciplinary action. Finally, if required by the citation a student may be required to appear in court; this is on a case-by-case basis and is specific to the infraction.
        </p>
        <p>
        There are also <a href="http://www.northwestern.edu/alcohol-resources/students/learn-the-rules/laws.html">Illinois state ordinances</a> that have their own potential consequences.
        </p>
        <h3 id="illegal-substances">What can/should I do if I am caught with illegal substances?</h3>
        <p>
        The use, possession, and sale or intent to sell of illegal substances is processed at three levels: the University, the City of Evanston, and at the state/federal level according to the <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs.asp">Illinois Compiled Statutes </a>and federal law.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h3 id="illegal-downloading">To what extent can I be punished for illegally downloading music on Northwestern&rsquo;s network? What are NUIT&#39;s policies regarding copyright violations?</h3>
        <p>
        In short, there is no set punishment for breaking copyright laws on campus. There are several factors that go into penalizing an infraction. Note that you could also be targeted for legal action by the holders of the copyright(s), as well as industry associations that represent them.
        </p>
        <p>
        The following are general copyright rules at Northwestern.
        </p>

        <h3 id="intellectual-property">What are my intellectual property rights/ How do I go about getting a patent?</h3>
        <p>
        A patent is governmental recognition of an invention (product or process) and legal protection of the associated intellectual property. Before pursuing a patent, proper research should be conducted to insure that the idea is novel. The first step in getting a patent is getting a provisional patent for $100 and allows the patent to be &ldquo;pending.&rdquo; The provisional patent must be filed within one year after public disclosure and allows one year before real patent application is completed.
        </p>

        Intellectual property is an idea, invention, trade secret, process, program, data, formula, patent, or right, that has value and results from activity of the mind. Like any property, it can be bought, sold, or donated. Intellectual property created by individuals in the course of performing their jobs is typically the property of the employer, while intellectual property created as a part of a &ldquo;work for hire&rdquo; contract is typically the property of the person who paid for the work. The IP guidelines for NU are as follows:

          In the case of inventions made by undergraduates at the University to fulfill class assignments, the University has never and does not intend to ever assert their rights provided that the students are not working in cooperation with a Northwestern research lab.
          </li>
          <li>
          Inventions voluntarily assigned to the University by students shall be owned by the University and are subject to the remaining provisions of the Patent and Invention Policy.

        <h3 id="starting-a-business">How can I go about starting a business?</h3>
        <p>
        The first step in forming a business is determining what type it will be. Factors that determine what type include for profit/non-for-profit, liability requirements, and ownership. Once a business type has been chosen, the appropriate paperwork must be filed with local, state, and federal government organizations. The following are some helpful resources for getting started:
